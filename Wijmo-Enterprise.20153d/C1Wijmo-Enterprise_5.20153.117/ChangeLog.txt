	  DropDown, including ComboBox, MultiSelect, InputDate, InputTime, etc).
	- Added a wijmo.grid.Column.dropDownCssClass property to make it easier to style
	  the drop-down list used to edit cells in columns that have dataMaps.
	- Added a wijmo.collections.CollectionView.useStableSort property that causes the
	  CollectionView class to use a stable sort algorithm which is 30 to 50% slower
	  than the native sort but maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed FlexSheet issue Formula menu does not open when entering '=' in Firefox.
	  (TFS 142491)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.112              Build Date: 01/16/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a new InputDateTime control to enter/edit date and time values using a
	  single control (as opposed to using an InputDate and an InputTime).
	- Added a new FlexGrid.imeEnbled property to support IME modes while the grid
	  is not in edit mode. This property benefits sites and applications in Japanese,
	  Chinese, Korean and other languages that require IME support.
	- Improved FlexGrid.focus() implementation to prevent the browser from scrolling 
	  the grid's hostElement into view when the grid gets the focus.
	- Improved allowAddNew to work better with childItemsPath.
	- Improved IE9 polyfill to support drag/drop in modal dialogs (TFS 140812)
    - Added Angular 2 Explorer sample with components for core Wijmo controls. The 
      sample uses Beta.1 version of Angular 2.
    - wijmo.xlsx
        -- Added support for several new functions:
            Column
            Columns
            COUNTA
            COUNTBLANK
            COUNTIF
            COUNTIFS
            DATE
            DATEDIF
            DCOUNT
            HLOOKUP
            HOUR
            INDEX
            MOD
            RANK
            RATE
            ROUNDDOWN
            ROUNDUP
            ROW
            ROWS
            SUBTOTAL
            SUMIF
            SUMIFS
            TIME
            TODAY 
        -- Added support for importing shared formulas.
        -- Improved performance.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet 
        -- Added support for user-provided custom functions, see the 
           FlexSheet.addCustomFunction method.
        -- Added FlexSheet.unknownFunction event that allows to process
           non-supported functions found in cell expressions.
        -- Added Sheet.itemsSource property that allows to change the items
           source for data bound sheets.

* Breaking changes
    - The wijmo.xlsx.XlsxConverter class is depreciated. Use the wijmo.xlsx.Workbook
      class instead. XlsxConverter is still supported for compatibility and will be
      eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx.FlexGridXlsxConverter class:
        -- the 'export', 'toWorkbookOM', 'import' and 'fromWorkbookOM' methods are depreciated.
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet.FlexSheet class:
        -- saveToWorkbookOM and loadFromWorkbookOM methods are depreciated. 
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.

* Bug fixes
	- Fixed grid to to include all items and sub-items in aggregates (TFS 139570,
	  partially fixed earlier in build 5.20143.35)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.109              Build Date: 12/10/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved CollectionView.trackChanges to allow tracking of changes made to items
	  that are not the current edit item. The most common scenario is pasting blocks
	  of data into a FlexGrid.
	- Improved FlexGrid.childItemsPath property to accept arrays of strings in case
	  items at different levels use different property names for their child items.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.108              Build Date: 12/06/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Changed the default value of the InputTime.step property to 15 (which seems
	  to be the most common/useful setting). This causes the control to display
	  the drop-down button by default; to remove the button, set the step property
	  to null.
	- Added support for opening FlexGrid.dataMap dropdowns using the keyboard
	  (F4, alt+up/down, like WinForms and WPF/Excel) (TFS 124408)
	- Improved the Control.dispose method to remove all Wijmo event listeners from the control
	  being disposed (dispose also removes all HTML event listeners added with the 
	  Control.addEventListener method).
	- Added a DropDown.autoExpandSelection property that determines whether input 
	  controls should automatically select whole words/numbers when clicked.
	  This applies to all controls that derive from DropDown, and makes it easier
	  to edit dates, times, colors, etc.
	- Added a ComboBox.headerPath property that allows decoupling the values shown in
	  the combo's input element from the values shown in the drop-down list.
	- Improved Globalize to support formatting of fiscal years and quarters with the 
	  following format specifiers:
		- 'EEEE': government fiscal year
		- 'eeee': corporations fiscal year
		- 'U': government fiscal quarter
		- 'u': corporations fiscal quarter
	  The conversion from calendar to fiscal date is culture-dependent. If you are 
	  not using the appropriate culture file (and don't want to), then you can 
	  specify the conversion factor by setting the 
	  wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffset variable to an array
	  containing two integers that represent the offset (in months) of the start of 
	  the fiscal year for government and for the private sector.
	  For example, the Japanese culture uses a three month offset for the government's
	  fiscal year and no offset for the private sector:
	      wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffsets = [3, 0];
    - Added five new glyphs to wijmo.css:
		wj-glyph-step-forward
		wj-glyph-step-backward
		wj-glyph-file
		wj-glyph-calendar
		wj-glyph-clock
	- Added automatic label rotation for FlexChart category x-axis. The labels are 
	  rotated to avoid overlapping if axis.labelAngle is not specified.	
	- Used IntelliSpell to spell-check all the documentation.
    - The FlexGridXlsxConverter class now supports row headers export. The behavior
      is controlled by the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions.includeRowHeaders property.

* Breaking changes
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx module, the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions interface:
        - 'needGetCellStyle' property has been renamed to 'includeCellStyles'. 
        - 'includeColumnHeader' property has been renamed to 'includeColumnHeaders' (ending 's'). 
      The old property names have been deprecated and will be removed in future builds.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.105              Build Date: 11/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Improved InputMask handling of delete key with masks that contain numbers in the
	  template (e.g. "99-55-9999", TFS 136087).
	- Added FlexGrid.selectedRows and selectedItems properties. Both can be used to get
	  a list with the currently selected rows or their associated data items. When the
	  selectionMode property is set to ListBox, they can also be used to set the selected 
	  rows or data items.
	- Refactored wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGrid filter by removing the OData-specific 
	  getODataFilterDefinition method and replacing it with a call to the collection
	  view's updateFilterDefinition method; which if present updates the filter definition
	  used on the server-side. This refactoring allows other CollectionView implementations
	  (such as BreezeCollectionView) to support server-side filtering.
	- Improved BreezeCollectionView sample to show server-side filtering (TFS 129832).
	- Added support for Japanese characters (IME, Katakana, Hiragana) in InputMask control.
	- Added a FlexGrid.showAlternatingRows property to allow disabling alternate row
	  styling without changing any CSS rules.
	- Added a FlexGrid.updatedView that fires when the grid finishes creating/updating the
	  cell elements for the current view (e.g. after binding, refreshing, resizing, scrolling, etc.)

* Bug fixes
	- InputDate control did not preserve the time part of the value being edited.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.102                Build Date: 10/29/2015   
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.xlsx module that provides client-side functionality for exporting and 
      importing to/from Excel xlsx file.
      The ExcelImportExport sample is updated with examples demonstrating its usage.
    - Added wijmo.grid.xlsx module, which is an extension to the wijmo.xlsx module,
      that provides client-side functionality for exporting and 
      importing FlexGrid to/from Excel xlsx file.
      The ExcelImportExport sample is updated to use this module.
    - Added wijmo.grid.sheet module, which is an extension to the wijmo.grid
      and wijmo.grid.xlsx modules. It implements the FlexSheet control
      that provides an Excel-like functionality.
      The ExcelBook sample is updated to use this module.
    - Added AngularJS PdfExport sample that implements client-side export
      of a FlexGrid control to PDF format.
	- Added AngularJS FlexChartAnimation sample. The sample shows chart animation
	  when loading and updating chart data.
	- Added AngularJS FlexChartZoom sample. The sample demonstrates chart interaction
	  using touch gestures or mouse.
	- Added PureJS AggregateSeries sample for FlexChart. The sample shows data aggregation
	  based on selected data range.
	- New RangeSelector.seamless property allows seamless transition between selector handles.
	- New appearance of RangeSelector handles simplifies dragging at smaller ranges.
	- New FinancialChart overlays: Bollinger Bands & Moving Average Envelopes.
	- New FinancialChart indicators: Average True Range, Relative Strength Index,
	  Commodity Channel Index, Williams %R, MACD/MACD Histogram, Stochastic Oscillator.
	- New Fibonacci Extensions for FinancialChart: Fans, Arcs, Time zones.
	- Improved wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGridFilter to allow filtering with merged headers.
	- Improved auto-generated column headers.
	  (we now capitalize first letter, break up camel-case binding strings, so the header
	  for a column bound to the 'productName' property becomes 'Product Name' be default).
    - Optimized wijmo.closest method to use 'matches' method instead of 'querySelectorAll'.
	- Improved InputNumber control behavior on mobile devices.
    - Added a FlexGrid.stickyHeaders property that keeps column header cells in view
	  even when the top of the grid scrolls off view.
	- Improved CollectionView change tracking to ignore items that are added and 
	  subsequently removed in the same session.
	- Improved Globalize to support formatting of date quarters with the 'q' or 'Q'
	  format specifiers (e.g. format(someDate, 'yyyy "Q"q') => '2014 Q4').

* Bug fixes
	- Fixed issue with legend hit test for pie chart(TFS 134321).
	- Fixed problem with focus after toggling legend items in Edge(TFS 132748).
	- Fixed problem with legend height when series names are long(TFS 132957).
	- Fixed issue with incorrect chart layout for category axis with long labels. 
	- Fixed issue with clipped y-axis labels(TFS 135127).
	- Fixed issue with minimum value should not allowed to set over maximum value in range selector(TFS 135758).
	- Improved InputNumber to deal with some mobile browser idiosyncrasies (TFS 135585)
	- Improved Globalize.parseDate to better handle Japanese formats (TFS 136057)


=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.93              Build Date: 10/14/2015
=========================================================================================

* Bug fixes
    - Destroying controls interfered with touch support in some scenarios.
	- Improved behavior of InputNumber on Windows Phone and a few other mobile devices.
	- Disabled HTML input auto-complete in InputNumber and DropDown controls 
	  (important for mobile browsers)
	- FlexGrid.selectionChanging event could not be canceled properly in ListBox 
	  selection mode.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.90              Build Date: 09/28/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added FlexGrid.pastingCell/pastedCell events. These events fire while the grid 
	  is pasting data into individual cells. Previously, the grid would fire editing
	  events in these situations, but that led to some ambiguities that affected the
	  implementation of custom editors.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.87              Build Date: 09/24/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added support for hexadecimal formatting/parsing; use format 'xn' or 'Xn' (TFS 131809)
	- Made AutoComplete control honor the "isEditable" property (inherited from ComboBox, TFS 81936)

* Bug fixes
	- FlexGrid.hitTest method did not set the edgeTop and edgeLeft properties correctly
	  on the returned HitTestInfo object.
	- Fixed problem with RowDetails in grids with frozen columns (TFS 131863).
	- Fixed problem with incorrect column width when series has auxiliary axis (TFS 131680). 
	- Fixed problem with major/minor units for time axis (TFS 131682).
	- Fixed JavaScript error in StockChart sample that may appear when moving marker (TFS 131856).
	- Updated MaskProvider to work with browsers that don't fire the keypress event.
	- Fixed chart rendering issue that may cause exception in Firefox under several conditions.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.86              Build Date: 09/20/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a wijmo.grid.CellFactory.disposeCell method to allow better resource cleanup
	  when using custom cell factories.
* Bug fixes
	- Globalize.parseDate failed on some locales (TFS 131320)
    - Fixed problem with incorrect position of selected pie slice label under several conditions (TFS 129756). 
    - Fixed issue with incorrect column widths after adding line series (TFS 131153).
    - Date values now correctly displayed on auxiliary axes (TFS 131294).
    - Fixed exception when using auxiliary axes with stacked bar chart (TFS 131295).
    - Fixed problem with minor ticks/gridlines for category axis (TFS 131297).
    - Fixed problem with hit testing for overlapped series (TFS 131330).
	- Could not cancel FlexGrid.startEditing event on checkbox cells.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.85              Build Date: 09/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved Angular FlexGrid.CellEdit template to use the character that was typed
	  when initiating the edits (as the built-in editors do).
	- Added a wijmo.odata.ODataVirtualCollectionView class that loads data on demand.
	  See the VirtualData sample for details.
	- ODataCollectionView.filterDefinition property is applied to filter on the server
	  even when filterOnServer is set to false. This allows applications to apply 
	  server and client-side filtering to the same collection.
	- Made FlexGrid.cellFactory property get/set.
	- Added a wijmo.grid.DataMap.isEditable property to allow users to enter data that
	  is not on the DataMap (mapped items become non-exclusive options).
    - wj-menu-item directive now supports AngularJS interpolation expressions and
      directives inside it, and can be used in conjunction with ng-repeat/ng-if
      directives.
    - Data-bound Menu controls now support wj-item-template directive that allows to
      define an arbitrary menu item content.
    - ng-class AngularJS directive is now supported on the wj-flex-grid-column and
      wj-flex-grid-cell-template directives.

* Bug fixes
	- CollectionView.removeAt method issued a notification event with index==-1 instead
	  of the original index of the item that was removed.
	- FlexGrid MergeManager did not always behave consistently when merging ranges that
	  included both row and column merging (TFS 129001)

* Breaking changes
    - Wijmo directives for AngularJS no longer update controller properties bound to 
      by-ref ('=') properties that logically suppose one-way binding.


=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.84              Build Date: 08/27/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a FlexGrid.showMarquee property that determines whether the grid should display
	  an Excel-style marquee around the current selection. The marquee may be styled using
	  the "wj-marquee" class selector.
	- Added a FlexGrid.showSelectedHeaders property that determines whether the grid should 
	  add a "wj-state-multi-selected" class selector to row and/or column header elements;
	  these can be used in CSS to highlight header cells that correspond to the current selection.
	- Added a new 'clip' parameter to the FlexGrid.getMergedRange method; if true (the default), 
	  the method clips the merged range to the current view range.
	  The 'clip' parameter has no effect on grid; it was added to facilitate the development 
	  of export utilities, which may need to get merged ranges that are not clipped to the 
	  grid's current view range.
	- Added Calendar.itemValidator and InputDate.itemValidator properties to enable preventing
	  certain days from being selected.
	- Added a Calendar.formatItem event to complement the Calendar.itemFormatter property.
	- LinearGauge now accounts for thumbSize when dimensioning the gauge's face.

* Bug fixes
	- Improved touch support in editable Gauges.
	- Fixed problem with chart type initialization in constructor parameter(TFS 125747).
    - Pie chart labels displayed correctly when it's position = 'Outside'(TFS 125423).
	- Chart does not change color's alpha if it was specified as rgba in palette (TFS 119543).

* Breaking changes

	- We made a small change to the logic that assigns classes to FlexGrid cells. Before, we 
	  removed the wj-group class from selected cells. That is no longer the case. There are 
	  two reasons for this change:

	  1) Correctness. Group cells remain group cells even when they are selected. Keeping the
	     wj-group class allows you to use CSS to style grouped and selected cells independently.
	  2) Performance. The new code is (very slightly) more efficient.

	  This change could break your custom FlexGrid CSS. If you have CSS rules that affect group 
	  colors they should be modified to exclude selected cells. In other words, if you had a 
	  rule like this:

		.wj-group {
			background: green;
		}

	  You should change it to this:

		.wj-group:not(.wj-state-selected):not(.wj-state-multi-selected) {
			background: green;
		}
  

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.76              Build Date: 08/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Added a new 'wj-state-focused' class to controls that contains the focus. This 
	  class is toggled automatically to reflect the control's focus state and can be 
	  used in CSS selectors to add focus-related styles to parts of focused controls,
	  such as gauge cursors, chart series, and grid ranges.
    - Added Angular attributes for chart series axisX and axisY (TFS 122055).
	- Added wijmo.input.DropDown.isDroppedDownChanging event to allow for customization
	  of the drop-down before it is shown.
	- Added wijmo.grid.filter.ValueFiler.uniqueValues property to specify the list of values 
	  to be shown on the list, which is more efficient than building the list from the data
	  and works on collections that are filtered on the server.
    - Improved features and performance of Globalize.formatDate and parseDate methods.
	- Added scaling specifiers to Globalization.formatNumber and parseFloat. For example,
	  'n0,' divides the value by one thousand, 'n0,,' by one million, and 'n0,,,' by one 
	  billion. The scaling specifiers are especially useful in charts based on large values
	  so the axis display scaled values which are easier to read and take up less space.
	- Added a Gauge.thumbSize property that enables displaying a 'thumb' element to show
	  the current value at the end of the 'pointer' range. This applies to linear and 
	  radial gauges.
	- Added mouse wheel support to editable Gauges.

* Bug fixes
	- Prevented AutoComplete from selecting all the text while the user types.
    - Fixed problem with toggling data series visibility for multiple y-axes(TFS 122051).
    - Fixed error in chart hit test demo(Explorer sample) TFS 124526.
    - Axis ticks displayed correctly with rotated labels(TFS 125399).
    - Axis ticks and grid lines rendered properly with overlapped axis labels(TFS 125273).
    - Chart focus events fire correctly in IE(TFS 124275).
    - Candlestick and HighLowOpenClose chart types now support 'rotated' property(TFS 118721).
    - Fixed problem with series visibility toggle when there are hidden series(TFS 110615). 
    - Fixed problem with major and minor grid lines for category x-axis(TFS 110250).
    - Chart updated correctly after changing axis 'reversed' property(TFS 100492).
    - Added angular attribute for axis 'overlappingLabels' property(TFS 98919).

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added support for numerous new cultures.

* Bug fixes

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.42          Build Date: 03/17/2015
=========================================================================================

    - Improved behavior of drop-down grid cells on mobile devices.
    - Added select-all functionality when the user clicks the top-left fixed cell.

      ListBox adds checkboxes to each item, and fires the itemChecked event when
      the current item is checked or unchecked.
    - Deprecated and removed the wijmo.isTouchDevice method. The method
      actually tested the browser, not the device, so it was useless.
    - Added a LineMarker class to the wijmo.chart module that provides FlexChart with a 
      continuous data point information with optional directional lines  
      as mouse pointer moves over a chart surface.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.interaction extension module with a RangeSelector class
      that allows the user to choose the range of data to display on the specified FlexChart.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate directive for Angular that allows to define
      a custom template for any type of a FlexGrid cell (column and row headers,
      editing cell, and so on).
    - Cell templates now support element level directives.
    - Wijmo child directives for Angular (like WjFlexGridColumn or WjFlexChartSeries),
      when used in conjunction with ng-repeat directive, now support full-functional
      synchronization with ng-repeat's source array, including items order.

* Bug fixes

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGrid.sortRowIndex property. This property determines the index of 
      the row in the column headers panel that displays the sort icon and can be clicked
      to sort the column. By default, it is set to null, causing the last row in the 
      panel to be the 'sort row.'
    - Raise editing events when pasting data into the FlexGrid (this allows users to
      prevent overwriting of specific cells when pasting).
    - Improved column filters to work with complex properties (e.g. 'state.name', 'state.pop').
    - Exposed wijmo.Binding class used to work with complex properties.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed several problems with rendering mixed chart types (TFS 96721, 98617).

    - Prevented users from dragging rows below the new row template (TFS 109012).
    - Fixed RTL layout so that it works properly in Safari (TFS 109371).
    - Fixed cell templates so that they are honored in GroupRows (regression).
    - Fixed a problem with dropdown controls on mobile browsers.
    - Fixed Wijmo directives for Angular so that they work with the ng-inspector tool.

Build Number 5.20143.35        Build Date: 02/09/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved the grouping logic of paged CollectionViews to avoid splitting groups
      between pages and to include all items in aggregates (as opposed to items in
      the current page which was the previous behavior; TFS 139570).
    - Added a CollectionView.sortConverter property. The property specifies a function
      that can be used to customize the sorting behavior of the CollectionView.
    - Improved FlexGrid sorting to take dataMaps into account. Now the grid sorts based
      on display value (as opposed to raw data values which was the previous behavior).
    - Expanded grid keyboard handling: now ctrl+home and ctrl+end navigate to the
      first and last cells on the grid (as opposed to home/end, which navigate to the
      first and last cells on the current row).
    - Added Gauge.origin property. This property determines the starting point used
      for painting the pointer range. Setting it to null causes the gauge to use
      the min property or zero if the range extends from negative to positive values.

* Bug fixes
    - Improved handling of star-sized columns in auto-sized grids; previously the grid
      could sometimes leave room on the right for a scrollbar that wasn't there.

* Breaking changes
    - Calling the wijmo.grid.DataMap constructor with an itemsSource but no selectedValuePath
      or displayMemberPath parameters used to create integer keys for the values; now the 
      array values are used both as values and as keys; this is more convenient for creating
      lists of strings that can be used with drop-downs and avoids the creation of arbitrary
      (and meaningless) keys.
