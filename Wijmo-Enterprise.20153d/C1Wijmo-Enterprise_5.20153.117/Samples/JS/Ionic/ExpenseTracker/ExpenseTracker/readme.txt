Expense Tracker
---------------------------
Shows how to create an expense tracker application with the Ionic Framework. This sample is intended to be used as a hybrid application.

This sample is a simple exepense tracking app created to showcase the Wijmo 5 
controls in a mobile app.

Prerequisites:

<pre>
1.)  Git
2.)  Node.js
3.)  Bower
4.)  Apache Cordova (Optional)
</pre>

Before running the sample, please install its dependencies using Bower.  To do this, open 
command line, navigate to the project's root directory (ExpenseTracker/ExpenseTracker), 
and run the following command:

<code>
bower install
</code>

You should now be able to run the sample in a web browser using Visual Studio or the Ionic 
CLI (ionic serve).

To run this sample on a mobile device or emulator, use the Cordova or Ionic CLI to add the plaftorm(s)
and run the app.  For example, the following commands will run the sample on the Android emulator for 
the first time:

<pre>
cordova platform add android

cordova emulate android
