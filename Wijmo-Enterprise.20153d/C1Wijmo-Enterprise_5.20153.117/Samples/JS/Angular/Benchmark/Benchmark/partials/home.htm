<p>
    To compare the performance of grid and chart controls, this application 
    creates an array with <b>{{data.length | number}}</b> data objects and 
    shows the data on the selected control. The application reports how 
    long the binding process took and shows the resulting control.</p>

<p>
    Keep in mind that binding performance is only one of the criteria to use 
    when choosing a control. Performance after the initial binding is also 
    important, and performance may not compensate for missing features.</p>
