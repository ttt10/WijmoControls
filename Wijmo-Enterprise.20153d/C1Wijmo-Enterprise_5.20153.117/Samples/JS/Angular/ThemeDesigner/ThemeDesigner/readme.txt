Theme Designer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Helps you to create custom Wijmo 5 themes.

Use the color pickers to build a theme, then copy the CSS into your project 
as a new custom theme.

Make sure to include wijmo.css and add this CSS after it to ensure it 
overrides the default theme. We recommend placing this CSS in a separate file.
