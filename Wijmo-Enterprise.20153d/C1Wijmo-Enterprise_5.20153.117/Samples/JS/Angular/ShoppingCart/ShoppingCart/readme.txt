ShoppingCartNG with Custom Directives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to create a store using our Input and Gauge controls and AngularJS.

This sample uses Wijmo 5, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.

The sample has three views: the store, product details, and shopping cart. Users can 
add products to the cart from the store, and they can edit the cart by changing
product quantities. When they are done, they can check out using PayPal payment services.

The application does not require any server support. It does not prompt users for
any personal information. All transaction details handled by PayPal.

Bootstrap is used to provide consistent styles, icons, and a fluid layout that 
adapts itself to desktop and mobile devices.

Wijmo 5 supports AngularJS. We ship and maintain AngularJS directives for all 
of our controls.
