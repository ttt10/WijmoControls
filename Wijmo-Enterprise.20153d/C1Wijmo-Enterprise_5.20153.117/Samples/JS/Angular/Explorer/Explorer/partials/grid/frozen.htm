    <h3>
        Frozen Cells
    </h3>
    <p>
        In some applications, it makes sense to 'freeze' certain rows and/or
        columns to they remain in view even when the grid is scrolled. For example,
        you may want to keep a column with product names visible on the left of the 
        grid and see the product data on the right of the grid.</p>
    <p>
        The FlexGrid <b>frozenRows</b> and <b>frozenColumns</b> properties allow
        you to achieve that. Use these properties to define the portion of the
        grid that should remain fixed and those parts of the grid will remain
        in view as if they were header columns. However, they can still be
        selected or edited as if they were regular cells.</p>
    <p>
        The example below allows you to freeze or unfreeze rows and columns
        by clicking the button.</p>
    <p>
        Clicking "Freeze" keeps the rows and columns above and to the left
        of the selection visible while the rest of the grid scrolls. Clicking
        "Unfreeze" unlock all rows and columns so they become scrollable.</p>

        {{flex.frozenRows || flex.frozenColumns ? 'Unfreeze' : 'Freeze'}}
    </button>
