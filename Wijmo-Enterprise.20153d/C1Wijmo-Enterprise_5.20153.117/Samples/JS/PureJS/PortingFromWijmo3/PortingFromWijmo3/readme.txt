Migrating from Wijmo 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page shows how to migrate from Wijmo 3 to Wijmo 5.

A simple application with a Grid and Chart bound to Arrays of data. The 
application features similar configurations of Wijmo 3 Widgets and Wijmo 5 
Controls to demonstrate migration.

To migrate from Wijmo 3 to Wijmo 5, you can use the same Arrays of data, 
but include them in a Wijmo 5 CollectionView. Then you simply bind the 
Wijmo 5 Controls to the CollectionView. 

Then you can customize the Wijmo 5 Controls to match the Wijmo 3 Widgets 
by applying similar properties as needed.
