ChartScaling
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how you can use log-based axes and scaling formats to make better charts.

Logarithmic axes can spread clustered data and improve the clarity of your 
charts without sacrificing accuracy.

Scaling formats can be used to display axis labels in a clear and concise format.
If your data contains values in billions or millions for example, scale 
formatters can be used to show the number of billions or millions instead
of the actual full values.
