Breeze
---------------------------
Shows how to update, add and remove data in FlexGrid, CollectionView and Inputs with BreezeJS. 

Breeze is a JavaScript library that helps you manage data in rich client applications.
It makes it easier to  store data in a database, query and save those data as complex 
object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript client. 
You can find out more about BreezeJS at http://www.breezejs.com.

The BreezeCollectionView class in this sample extends the Wijmo CollectionView class
to manage the data through Breeze. BreezeCollectionView loads data from a datasource
using a Breeze Entity Manager and Query. You can select whether you want sorting and
paging to be performed on the server or on the client.

Changes made to the view are automatically persisted on the server.

This sample uses the FlexGrid control to show and edit the data and to synchronize 
the operations with BreezeJS. The sample is based on one of the Breeze samples which 
you can find here:
