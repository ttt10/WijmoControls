OData
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to use the wijmo.odata.ODataCollectionView to connect to OData services.

OData is a standardized protocol for creating and consuming data APIs. 
OData builds on core protocols like HTTP and commonly accepted methodologies like REST. 
The result is a uniform way to expose full-featured data APIs. (http://www.odata.org/)

The ODataCollectionView class extends the Wijmo CollectionView class to connect 
to OData services. ODataCollectionView loads data from OData tables and writes 
changes back to the server.

You can select whether you want sorting, paging, and filtering to be performed 
on the server or on the client.

You can use the result objects from the OData service as data sources for any
Wijmo controls, and in addition to full CRUD support and real-time updates you
automatically get CollectionView features including sorting, filtering, paging,
and grouping.
